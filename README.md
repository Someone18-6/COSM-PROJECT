## Overview
The project focuses on understanding statistical methods and applying them on datasets.  
We performed:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Covariance & correlation analysis  
- Hypothesis testing (Chi-square, t-test, F-test)  
- Simple & multiple linear regression  
- Visual interpretation using graphs  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- CSV datasets  

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository  
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter  
3. Run the cells in order  
4. Check graphs, tables, and statistical results  

## Folder Structure
- `notebooks/` – all .ipynb files  
- `datasets/` – CSV files used  
- `results/` – graphs, summaries, and outputs  
- `README.md` – project documentation
